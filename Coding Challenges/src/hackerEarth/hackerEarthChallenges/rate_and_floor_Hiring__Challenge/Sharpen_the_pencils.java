 * 
 *         Madhav and Riya were getting bored. So they decided to play a game.
 *         They placed N pencils in a line. Madhav starts to sharpen pencil from
 *         left to right, and Riya from right to left. For each pencil, its
 *         length is known. Madhav sharpens with speed twice that of Riya. If a
 *         player starts to sharpen the pencil, other player can't touch it. If
 *         both players reach the same pencil simultaneously, Madhav gets to
 *         sharpen pencil as he snatches it away from Riya.
 * 
 *         How many pencils each of the players will sharpen?
 * 
 *         Input
 * 
 *         The first line contains one integer T, the number of test cases. The
 *         first line of each test case contains one integer N,the number of
 *         pencils. The second line contains a sequence , A1, A2, A3 . . . An
 *         where Ai denotes length of ith pencil.
 * 
 *         Output Print two numbers X and Y separated by space, where X is the
 *         number of pencils sharpened by Madhav, and Y is the number of pencils
 *         sharpened by Riya.
