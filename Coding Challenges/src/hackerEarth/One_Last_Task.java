/**
 * @author Aakansha Doshi
 * 
 *         Ramesh and Suresh are now given One Last Task, to distribute tickets
 *         to all the students as their admissions are finalized. Sounds simple,
 *         but there's one twist, they are supposed to give 1 ticket to the
 *         first student, 2 tickets to the second student, 3 tickets to the
 *         third student and so on. Now, the professor knows the total no. of
 *         admitted students. So, he would tell them the number of students n
 *         and ask the total no. of tickets required. The One who tells all the
 *         answers correctly gets admitted to the College.
 * 
 *         Input: The first line of the input contains T, the number of test
 *         cases. T lines follow. Each test case contains a single integer N
 *         denoting the no. of students.
 * 
 *         Output: Print the total no. of stickers required for each test case
 *         in a new line.
