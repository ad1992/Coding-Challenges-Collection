 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *         Alice gives a wooden board composed of M X N wooden square pieces to
 *         Bob and asks him to find the minimal cost of breaking the board into
 *         square wooden pieces. Bob can cut the board along horizontal and
 *         vertical lines, and each cut divides the board in smaller parts. Each
 *         cut has a cost depending on whether the cut is made along a
 *         horizontal or a vertical line.
 * 
 *         Let us denote the costs of cutting it along consecutive vertical
 *         lines by x1, x2, ..., xn-1, and the cost of cutting it along
 *         horizontal lines by y1, y2, ..., ym-1. If a cut (of cost c) is made
 *         and it passes through n segments, then total cost of this cut will be
 *         n*c.
 * 
 *         The cost of cutting the whole board into single squares is the sum of
 *         the cost of successive cuts used to cut the whole board into square
 *         wooden pieces of size 1x1. Bob should compute the minimal cost of
 *         breaking the whole wooden board into squares of size 1x1.
 * 
 *         Bob needs your help to find the minimal cost. Can you help Bob with
 *         this challenge?
 * 
 *         Input Format A single integer in the first line T, stating the number
 *         of test cases. T testcases follow. For each test case, the first line
 *         contains two positive integers M and N separated by a single space.
 *         In the next line, there are integers y1, y2, ..., ym-1, separated by
 *         spaces. Following them are integers x1, x2, ..., xn-1, separated by
 *         spaces.
 * 
 *         Output Format For each test-case, write an integer in separate line
 *         which denotes the minimal cost of cutting the whole wooden board into
 *         single wooden squares. Since the answer can be very large, output the
 *         answer modulo 10^9+7.
