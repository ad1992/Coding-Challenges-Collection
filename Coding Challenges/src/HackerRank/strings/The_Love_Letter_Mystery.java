 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *         James found a love letter his friend Harry has written for his
 *         girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the
 *         letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.
 * 
 *         To do this, he follows two rules:
 * 
 *         He can reduce the value of a letter, e.g. he can change d to c, but
 *         he cannot change c to d. In order to form a palindrome, if he has to
 *         repeatedly reduce the value of a letter, he can do it until the
 *         letter becomes a. Once a letter has been changed to a, it can no
 *         longer be changed.
 * 
 *         Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single
 *         operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert
 *         a given string into a palindrome.
 * 
 *         Input Format
 * 
 *         The first line contains an integer T, i.e., the number of test cases.
 *         The next T lines will contain a string each. The strings do not
 *         contain any spaces.
 * 
 *         Constraints 1≤T≤10 1≤ length of string ≤10^4 All characters are lower
 *         case English letters.
 * 
 *         Output Format
 * 
 *         A single line containing the number of minimum operations
 *         corresponding to each test case.
