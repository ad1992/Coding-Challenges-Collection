/**
 *		  
 * 		   Little Chandan is an exceptional manager - apart from his
 *         role in HackerEarth - as the person who has to bug everyone, in
 *         general... and if possible, try to get some work done. * 
 *         He's also offered a job as the coach of the best Russian teams
 *         participating for ACM-ICPC World Finals. Now, Chandan is an extremely
 *         good coach, too. But he's a weird person who thrives on patterns in
 *         life, in general. So, he has decided that if there are n number of
 *         students in total, and he is supposed to divide them in camps of k
 *         students - he want them to be arranged in such a way that the length
 *         of names of all the students in a camp is equal. * 
 *         I know, totally weird, right?
