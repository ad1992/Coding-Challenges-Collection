/**
 * @author Aakansha Doshi
 * 
 *         In his childhood, Utkarsh had a Graph having N nodes and N-1 edges.
 *         It was always possible to go from any node to any other node via a
 *         path. Now after so many years he has discovered the same Graph in the
 *         store room of his house. But many edges of the Graph are now
 *         destroyed. Formally now Utkarsh has only M edges of the old Graph. He
 *         wants to know how many unordered pairs (A, B) exist such that A and B
 *         were not connected via a direct edge in the original graph.
 * 
 *         Note: Unordered pairs means you have to count pairs (a, b) and (b, a)
 *         once.
 * 
 *         Constraints N ≤ 105 M ≤ N-1
 * 
 *         Input First line contains N and M. Next M lines contains a pair each,
 *         A B denoting an edge between A and B in the presently discovered
 *         graph.
 * 
 *         Output A single integer, the answer to the problem.
