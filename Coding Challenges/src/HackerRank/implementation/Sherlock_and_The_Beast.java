 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *         Sherlock Holmes is getting paranoid about Professor Moriarty, his
 *         arch-enemy. All his efforts to subdue Moriarty have been in vain.
 *         These days Sherlock is working on a problem with Dr. Watson. Watson
 *         mentioned that the CIA has been facing weird problems with their
 *         supercomputer, 'The Beast', recently.
 * 
 *         This afternoon, Sherlock received a note from Moriarty, saying that
 *         he has infected 'The Beast' with a virus. Moreover, the note had the
 *         number N printed on it. After doing some calculations, Sherlock
 *         figured out that the key to remove the virus is the largest Decent
 *         Number having N digits.
 * 
 *         A Decent Number has the following properties:
 * 
 *         3, 5, or both as its digits. No other digit is allowed. Number of
 *         times 3 appears is divisible by 5. Number of times 5 appears is
 *         divisible by 3.
 * 
 *         Meanwhile, the counter to the destruction of 'The Beast' is running
 *         very fast. Can you save 'The Beast', and find the key before
 *         Sherlock?
 * 
 *         Input Format The 1st line will contain an integer T, the number of
 *         test cases. This is followed by T lines, each containing an integer
 *         N. i.e. the number of digits in the number.
 * 
 *         Output Format Largest Decent Number having N digits. If no such
 *         number exists, tell Sherlock that he is wrong and print âˆ’1.
