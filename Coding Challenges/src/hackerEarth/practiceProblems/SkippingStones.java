/**
 * 			 @username Aakansha Doshi
 * 			 My flatmate, Sayan, went to the game show called Takeshi's
 *           castle.It is a game show in which you need to pass different game
 *           challenges to enter the final. 
 *           Now the most famous round of all of them is the "skipping stones".In the game you need to go from one end of a
 *           small puddle to the other end of it stepping on stones.Some of the
 *           stones are fixed while others sink as soon as you step on them. * 
 *           Now Sayan managd to bribe the gaurd and gather the information
 *           regarding each of the stones in the puddle. So he now knows the
 *           probability p of each stone staying stationary, i.e, the
 *           probability of stepping on a stone and not sinking is p.* 
 *           Now , as common sense suggests, Sayan can cross the puddle only if
 *           he steps on stationary stones only. 
 *           But Sayan, being a human being, has a fixed span of distance(L)
 *           which he can jump at once.You need to find out and inform Sayan the
 *           best probability of him crossing the puddle without sinking.* 
 *           NOTE: He can jump from one stone to another only if it is within L
 *           metres of distance.
