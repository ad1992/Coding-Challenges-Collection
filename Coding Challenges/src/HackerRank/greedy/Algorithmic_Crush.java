 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *          
 *         Devendra is on cloud nine after seeing his crush smiling at him in
 *         class. At that very moment his professor singles him out and asks him
 *         a question. Devendra's mind is all too fuzzy with his crush and her
 *         smile to concentrate on anything else. Help him solve the problem :
 * 
 *         You are given a list of size N, initialized with zeroes. You have to
 *         perform M operations on the list and output the maximum of final
 *         values of all the N elements in the list. For every operation, you
 *         are given three integers a, b and k and you have to add value k to
 *         all the elements ranging from index a to b(both inclusive).
 * 
 *         Input Format First line will contain two integers N and M separated
 *         by a single space. Next M lines will contain three integers a, b and
 *         k separated by a single space. Numbers in list are numbered from 1 to
 *         N.
 * 
 *         Output Format A single line containing maximum value in the updated
 *         list.
