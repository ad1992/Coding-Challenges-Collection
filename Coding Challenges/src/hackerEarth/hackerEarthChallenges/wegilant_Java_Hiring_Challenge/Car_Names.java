/**
 * @author Aakansha Doshi
 * 
 *         Brian built his own car and was confused about what name he should
 *         keep for it. He asked Roman for help. Roman being his good friend,
 *         suggested a lot of names. Brian only liked names that: - Consisted of
 *         exactly three distinct characters, say C1, C2 and C3 - Satisfied the
 *         criteria that the string was of the form - C1n C2n C3n : This means,
 *         first C1 occurs n times, then C2 occurs n times and then C3 occurs n
 *         times. For example, xyz, ccaarr, mmmiiiaaa satisfy the criteria, but
 *         xyzw, aabbbcccc don't. Given N names suggested by Roman, print "OK"
 *         if Brian likes the name and "Not OK" if he doesn't.
 * 
 *         Input: First line contains a single positive integer N - the number
 *         of names. N lines follow - each line contains a name.
 * 
 *         Output: For each name, Print "OK" if the name satisfies the criteria,
 *         else print "Not OK", on a new line.
