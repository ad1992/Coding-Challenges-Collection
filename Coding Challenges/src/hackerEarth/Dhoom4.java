 *
 * 		   Samarpit is the main hero of the Dhoom 4.He is trying to
 *         steal from the Code Bank Of Hackers.Samarpit has a key with an
 *         integer value printed on it. He also has N other keys with each key
 *         having its own specific value.Samarpit is trying to break the Lock
 *         for which he is supposed to get to the lock's key value. He can
 *         perform one type of operation.Take his own key and one of the other N
 *         keys and merge them.During merging Samarpit's Key value changes to
 *         product of both the keys modulus 100000.
 * 
 *         For example if his key value was X and he took a key with value Y the
 *         his new key will be (X*Y)%100000.The other key that was used during
 *         the merging process remains along with other N-1 keys.
 * 
 *         This entire process of merging takes 1 second.Now since he is in a
 *         hurry he asks to you to find the minimum time in which he could reach
 *         to the lock's key value.
