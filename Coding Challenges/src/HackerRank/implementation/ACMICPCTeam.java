 * 
 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *         You are given a list of N people who are attending ACM-ICPC World
 *         Finals. Each of them are either well versed in a topic or they are
 *         not. Find out the maximum number of topics a 2-person team can know.
 *         And also find out how many teams can know that maximum number of
 *         topics.
 * 
 *         Note Suppose a, b, and c are three different people, then (a,b) and
 *         (b,c) are counted as two different teams.
 * 
 *         Input Format
 * 
 *         The first line contains two integers, N and M, separated by a single
 *         space, where N represents the number of people, and M represents the
 *         number of topics. N lines follow. Each line contains a binary string
 *         of length M. If the ith line's jth character is 1, then the ith
 *         person knows the jth topic; otherwise, he doesn't know the topic.
 * 
 *         Constraints 2≤N≤500 1≤M≤500
 * 
 *         Output Format
 * 
 *         On the first line, print the maximum number of topics a 2-person team
 *         can know. On the second line, print the number of 2-person teams that
 *         can know the maximum number of topics.
