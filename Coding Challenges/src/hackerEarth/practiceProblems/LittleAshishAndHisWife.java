/**
 * @username aa1992
 * 		   Little Ashish had no interest in studying ever in his life.
 *         So, he always wanted to marry as soon as possible, and kept forcing
 *         his parents to get him married. He thought his married life was going
 *         to be fun. But, well, surprise, surprise... it's not - not for him,
 *         at least.
 * 
 *         Fulfilling the demands of his wife is a huge problem for him. She
 *         wants costumes, a lot of them - and it's getting impossible for
 *         Ashish to buy her all the clothes she asks for. Fortunately, for
 *         Ashish, he knows that out of n dresses, his wife only needs x
 *         different type of dresses. Now Ashish doesn't want to spend and waste
 *         a lot of time on this whole thing - so the only strategy he's decided
 *         to follow is to not follow any strategy - that is to say, he gets all
 *         the n dresses, and gifts them to his wife for her to figure out how
 *         many different dresses has he managed to bring.
 * 
 *         Given the number of dresses, n, number of dresses he has to select, x
 *         - find out what his wife feels for him.
