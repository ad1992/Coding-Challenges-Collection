 *         Chandu and chandni Talk on phone for a long time daily. Being afraid
 *         that someone will hear their private conversation chandu suggested
 *         chandni an idea. He suggested that he will talk only with encrypted
 *         strings with her and only she would know, how to decrypt the string.
 *         So that even if someone hears, He/She would not be able to anticipate
 *         their conversation.
 * 
 *         Rules of encryption are as follows: 1. String on length N is assumed
 *         to be cyclic consisting of lower case English alphabets. 2. In each
 *         iteration, we pick the last character and put it in starting of the
 *         string. For example: april performing iterations and collecting each
 *         string formed in a set until we get the original string. Ex:
 *         {april,lapri, ilapr, rilap, prila} 3. sort the set of string in
 *         lexicographically reverse order. Ex: {rilap, prila,lapri, ilapr,
 *         april } 4. Taking the last character of each string in the set is the
 *         encrypted string. Ex: pairl
 * 
 *         Chandu also sends the position(K) of first letter in encrypted string
 *         from original string i.e 2 (p is on position 2 in original string and
 *         is the first character of encrypted string)
 * 
 *         Now, Chandni is ofcourse not that brilliant to decrypt the strings in
 *         real time and understand what chandu is saying. So, chandu decided to
 *         write a program for the same.
 * 
 *         Help chandu write this program.
