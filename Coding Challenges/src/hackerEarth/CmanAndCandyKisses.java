    * Cman doesn't love math anymore. He loves Alisha. Alisha is cute. :) Cman goes
    * on a date with her. They go to a candy shop. Alisha loves candies. The shop
    * has n number of jars, each jar having a different type of candy. Alisha wants
    * to taste all type of candies so she asks Cman to buy candies for her. She
    * also asks Cman to buy at least X[i] candies of type i. Cost of each candy is
    * $1. Cman has forgotten to bring his wallet so the poor guy has no money. Cman
    * has to anyhow buy these candies for Alisha. So, he asks the shopkeeper for
    * help and looking at the condition of Cman, the shopkeeper agrees to help Cman
    * but on a condition. Shopkeeper puts the condition that he will give Cman
    * candies of $R for free if Cman can tell him the total number of ways to
    * select the candies such that it fulfills Alisha's condition of getting at
    * least X[i] candies of type i and also the sum of candies result in total cost
    * of exactly $R. As things are awkward between Cman and math currently, he asks
    * you for help. So, your task is to help Cman to find the resulting number of
    * ways modulo 10^9 +7 so that he can get candies for free and can make Alisha
    * happy. P.S. : Alisha will give a kiss to Cman if he buys the required number
    * of candies for her. So, your task is to help Cman to get a kiss. :?)
