/**
 * @username Aakansha Doshi
 * 
 *           Xsquare loves to eat chocolates like we all do. Xsquare's father
 *           has given him a chocolate bar B of length N where each chocolate
 *           piece is either of strawberry flavour S or of caramel flavour C.
 *           Xsquare's mom does not want him to eat all the chocolates as she
 *           thinks that consumption of too many chocolates will make him
 *           chocoholic. Therefore, she decided to take some chocolates back
 *           from him. She has some empty boxes to keep chocolates. Each box can
 *           contain exactly three chocolates. No box can contain all the
 *           chocolates of same flavour. She has ordered Xsquare to return her
 *           back, the longest contiguous sub-bar of the original chocolate bar
 *           such that she can place every three consecutive chocolates from
 *           that contiguous chocolate bar in an empty box. Each empty box can
 *           accomodate exactly three chocolates, neither less, nor more. A
 *           sub-bar is defined as contiguous peices of chocolates in some
 *           particular range.
 * 
 *           Xsquare agrees to whatever his mom has ordered. Now, he is
 *           wondering how many chocolates he is able to eat at the end after he
 *           returns the longest contiguous sub-bar.
 * 
 *           Help him in accomplishing this task.
