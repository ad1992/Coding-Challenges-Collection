 * As we all know RK loves his name very much especially the character 'R' so
 * this time task for you is based on his awesome name. RK gives you a string S
 * consisting of characters 'R' and 'K' only. Now you are allowed to do exactly
 * one move that is you have to choose two indices i and j (1<=i<=j<=|S| where
 * |S| is string length ) and flip all the characters at position X where
 * i<=X<=j. Flipping the character means :
 * 
 * if S[X]='R' : //If character at position X is 'R' then change it to 'K'
 * S[X]='K' else : //else if character at position X is 'K' then change it to
 * 'R' S[X]='R'
 * 
 * Now your goal is that after exactly one move you have to obtain the maximum
 * number of R's as RK loves this character very much. So help RK with maximum
 * R's.
