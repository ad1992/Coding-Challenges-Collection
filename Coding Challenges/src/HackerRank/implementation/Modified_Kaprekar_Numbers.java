 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *         A modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number n with d
 *         digits, such that when we split its square into two pieces - a right
 *         hand piece r with d digits and a left hand piece l that contains the
 *         remaining d or d−1 digits, the sum of the pieces is equal to the
 *         original number (i.e. l + r = n).
 * 
 *         Alternatively, a modified Kaprekar number is a positive whole number
 *         n with 2d digits (if its number of digits is even) or 2d + 1 digits
 *         (if its number of digits is odd), such that when we split its square
 *         into two pieces, a right hand piece r containing d or d + 1 digits,
 *         and a left piece l containing the remaining d digits, the sum of the
 *         two pieces is equal to the original number.
 * 
 *         Note: r may have leading zeros.
 * 
 *         Here's an alternative explanation from Wikipedia: In mathematics, a
 *         Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the
 *         representation of whose square in that base can be split into two
 *         parts that add up to the original number again. For instance, 45 is a
 *         Kaprekar number, because 45² = 2025 and 20+25 = 45.
 * 
 *         The Task You are given the two positive integers p and q, where p is
 *         lower than q. Write a program to determine how many Kaprekar numbers
 *         are there in the range between p and q (both inclusive) and display
 *         them all.
 * 
 *         Input Format
 * 
 *         There will be two lines of input: p, lowest value q, highest value
 * 
 *         Constraints: 0<p<q<100000
 * 
 *         Output Format
 * 
 *         Output each Kaprekar number in the given range, space-separated on a
 *         single line. If no Kaprekar numbers exist in the given range, print
 *         INVALID RANGE.
