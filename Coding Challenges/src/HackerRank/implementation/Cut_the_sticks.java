 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *         You are given N sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive
 *         integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of
 *         them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.
 * 
 *         Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:
 * 
 *         5 4 4 2 2 8
 * 
 *         Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the
 *         six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of
 *         non-zero length), whose lengths are the following:
 * 
 *         3 2 2 6
 * 
 *         The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.
 * 
 *         Given the length of N sticks, print the number of sticks that are
 *         left before each subsequent cut operations.
 * 
 *         Note: For each cut operation, you have to recalcuate the length of
 *         smallest sticks (excluding zero-length sticks).
 * 
 *         Input Format The first line contains a single integer N. The next
 *         line contains N integers: a0, a1,...aN-1 separated by space, where ai
 *         represents the length of ith stick.
 * 
 *         Output Format For each operation, print the number of sticks that are
 *         cut, on separate lines.
