/**
 * @username Aakansha Doshi
 * 
 *           Xsquare got bored playing with the arrays all the time. Therefore,
 *           he has decided to play with the strings. Xsquare called a string P
 *           a "double string" if string P is not empty and can be broken into
 *           two strings A and B such that A + B = P and A = B. for eg : strings
 *           like "baba" , "blabla" , "lolo" are all double strings whereas
 *           strings like "hacker" , "abc" , "earth" are not double strings at
 *           all.
 * 
 *           Today, Xsquare has a special string S consisting of lower case
 *           English letters. He can remove as many characters ( possibly zero )
 *           as he wants from his special string S. Xsquare wants to know , if
 *           its possible to convert his string S to a double string or not.
 * 
 *           Help him in accomplishing this task.
