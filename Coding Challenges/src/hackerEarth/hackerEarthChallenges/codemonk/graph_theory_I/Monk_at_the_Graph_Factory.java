/**
 * @author Aakansha Doshi
 * 
 *         Our Code Monk recently learnt about Graphs and is very excited!
 * 
 *         He went over to the Graph-making factory to watch some freshly
 *         prepared graphs. Incidentally, one of the workers at the factory was
 *         ill today, so Monk decided to step in and do her job.
 * 
 *         The Monk's Job is to Identify whether the incoming graph is a tree or
 *         not. He is given N, the number of vertices in the graph and the
 *         degree of each vertex.
 * 
 *         Find if the graph is a tree or not.
 * 
 *         Input: First line contains an integer N, the number of vertices.
 *         Second line contains N space-separated integers, the degrees of the N
 *         vertices.
 * 
 *         Output: Print "Yes" (without the quotes) if the graph is a tree or
 *         "No" (without the quotes) otherwise.
