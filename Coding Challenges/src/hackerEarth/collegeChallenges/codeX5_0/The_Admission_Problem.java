 * 
 *         Results are out and admission process has begun in most of the
 *         colleges. This is the story of two such young engineering aspirants,
 *         Ramesh and Suresh, who intend to make it big in life.
 * 
 *         They met each other during the admission phase of some college and
 *         have become friends. But that does not mean they aren't competitors.
 *         They both have scored the exact same marks in JEE Mains and also in
 *         their boards and so, right now, it's a tie on who is more
 *         intelligent. No one likes ties, so in order to determine who is the
 *         smarter of them both they decided to ask a Mathematics Professor, at
 *         the college they currently are applying to, to give both of them a
 *         problem to solve and the one who solves it first is smarter. By now
 *         it should be evident that the strong point of both of them is
 *         Mathematics.
 * 
 *         The mathematics professor had been in that college since its
 *         inception and had seen plenty such Ramesh and Suresh pairs competing
 *         each other. It was no big deal for him as this happened quite a lot
 *         and he found such competition healthy. He gave them both a very
 *         simple task which was to find the Ramanujan Number but not just any
 *         Ramanujan Number.
 * 
 *         He would simply give them a number, N, and they would have to find
 *         the Nth Ramanujan Number. Also, finding the number just once would
 *         not be a wise option and so he would repeat the same thing several
 *         times.
 * 
 *         You are here, not just to see who wins between Ramesh and Suresh.
 *         Your task is to help the professor. You don't expect him to remember
 *         all the Ramanujan Numbers by heart, do you? But in order to determine
 *         the winner, the professor must himself know the answer. Provide him
 *         with the answer key so that he shall determine the winner!
 * 
 *         Input: First line of input will contain a number, t. It is the number
 *         of numbers the professor gives them both. Each of the next t lines
 *         would contain a number, N.
 * 
 *         Output: t lines, each of which contain the Nth Ramanujan Number.
