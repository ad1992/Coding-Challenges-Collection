 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *         You are given an integer N. Find the digits in this number that
 *         exactly divide N (division that leaves 0 as remainder) and display
 *         their count. For N=24, there are 2 digits (2 & 4). Both of these
 *         digits exactly divide 24. So our answer is 2.
 * 
 *         Note
 * 
 *         If the same number is repeated twice at different positions, it
 *         should be counted twice, e.g., For N=122, 2 divides 122 exactly and
 *         occurs at ones' and tens' position. So for this case, our answer is
 *         3. Division by 0 is undefined.
 * 
 *         Input Format
 * 
 *         The first line contains T (the number of test cases), followed by T
 *         lines (each containing an integer N).
 * 
 *         Constraints 1≤T≤15 0<N<1010
 * 
 *         Output Format
 * 
 *         For each test case, display the count of digits in N that exactly
 *         divide N in a separate line.
 * 
 *         Sample Input
 * 
 *         2 12 1012
 * 
 *         Sample Output
 * 
 *         2 3
 * 
 *         Explanation
 * 
 *         2 digits in the number 12 divide it exactly. The first digit, 1,
 *         divides it exactly in twelve parts, and the second digit, 2 divides
 *         12 equally in six parts.
 * 
 *         1 divides 1012 exactly (and it occurs twice), and 2 also divides it
 *         exactly. Division by 0 is undefined, therefore it will not be
 *         counted.
