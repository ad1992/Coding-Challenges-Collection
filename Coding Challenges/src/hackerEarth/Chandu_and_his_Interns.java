 *         Chandu is a very strict mentor. He always gives a lot of work to his
 *         interns. So his interns decided to kill him. There is a party in the
 *         office on Saturday Night, and the interns decided to kill him on the
 *         same day. In the party, there are N beer bottles. Each bottle has a
 *         integer X written on it. Interns decided to mix poison in some of the
 *         beer bottles. They made a plan that they will add poison into a
 *         bottle only if the integer on the beer bottle has number of divisors
 *         strictly less than 4. Chandu came to know about the plan of the
 *         interns. So he needs to your help to save his life. Tell Chandu if he
 *         can drink the beer or not.
 * 
 *         Input: First line of contains an integer N, denoting the number of
 *         bottles. Each test case contains an integer X, denoting the number on
 *         the beer bottle.
 * 
 *         Output: For each beer bottle, print YES if Chandu can drink that
 *         beer, otherwise print NO.
