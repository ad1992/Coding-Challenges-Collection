 * 
 *         Alice recently started learning about cryptography and found that
 *         anagrams are very useful. Two strings are anagrams of each other if
 *         they have same character set and same length. For example strings
 *         "bacdc" and "dcbac" are anagrams, while strings "bacdc" and "dcbad"
 *         are not.
 * 
 *         Alice decides on an encryption scheme involving 2 large strings where
 *         encryption is dependent on the minimum number of character deletions
 *         required to make the two strings anagrams. She need your help in
 *         finding out this number.
 * 
 *         Given two strings (they can be of same or different length) help her
 *         in finding out the minimum number of character deletions required to
 *         make two strings anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from any of
 *         the strings.
 * 
 *         Input Format Two lines each containing a string.
 * 
 *         Constraints 1 <= Length of A,B <= 10000 A and B will only consist of
 *         lowercase latin letter.
 * 
 *         Output Format A single integer which is the number of character
 *         deletions.
