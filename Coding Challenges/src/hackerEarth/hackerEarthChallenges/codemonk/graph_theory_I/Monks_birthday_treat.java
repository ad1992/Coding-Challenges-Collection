 * 
 *         Little Monk is an extremely miser person. He hates spending money on
 *         things, be it for his own good or bad. But this time his friends have
 *         caught up with him, and are demanding a huge birthday treat. But,
 *         Monk is... well, Monk.
 * 
 *         He figured out that there is no way for him to save himself and his
 *         money now. So, he decided to treat as many friends as he can. But, he
 *         still thought that he could skip inviting those friends who don't
 *         have any dependency. That is to say that, let's say that he has N
 *         friends, and a friend Ai wouldn't come to the party if Aj is not
 *         invited. But, it's not necessary that the vice-versa is true.
 * 
 *         Monk wants to invite minimum number of friends to celebrate his
 *         birthday party to save money - help Monk figure out the minimum
 *         number of friends he can invite while fulfilling their demands. He
 *         cannot have a party without any friend, so he HAS to take one friend
 *         with him, at least to celebrate his birthday, by the way.
 * 
 *         Input: The first line will contain two integers, N and D, where N
 *         denotes the number of friends, while D denotes the number of
 *         dependency relations. The next D lines will contain two integers, a
 *         and b - which would represent that friend a wouldn't come to the
 *         party until and unless friend b is also invited.
 * 
 *         Output: Print the minimal number - minimum number of friends Monk can
 *         invite while handling the demands and celebrating his birthday still.
