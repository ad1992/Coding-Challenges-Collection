 * 		   IIT-Delhi has been invaded by aliens. An alien race from a
 *         galaxy far away is shooting a beam on the Academic Block of
 *         IIIT-Delhi. Everyone is frightened by this attack. On each day a beam
 *         is shot on roof of Academic Block and there is great shaking in the
 *         block. IIIT-Delhi AlienAttack team has decided to make a layer to be
 *         put up on roof of the Academic block which can absorb this beam and
 *         thus protect the block from the beam. The AlienAttack team knows how
 *         to make this layer but for this they need to know the strength of
 *         beam falling on this layer. Babulal, guard of IIIT-Delhi has analysed
 *         the strength of beam and has found that the strength of beam on any
 *         day is the strength of beam on the previous day plus the twice the
 *         strength of beam on the day before previous day. Babulal then shared
 *         this analysis with the team. Now considering Babulalâ€™s analysis
 *         AlienAttack team has to find the strength of the beam on Day N. So,
 *         consider yourself a part of the team and give the minimum strength
 *         that the layer should have to protect the block against the beam.
 *         Given the strength of beam on day one is 2 megapower and on day two
 *         is 7 megapower, you have to find the strength on day N. As the value
 *         of strength on Day N can be very large print the result modulo 10^9 +7.
