 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *         You and your K-1 friends want to buy N flowers. Flower number i has
 *         cost ci. Unfortunately the seller does not want just one customer to
 *         buy a lot of flowers, so he tries to change the price of flowers for
 *         customers who have already bought some flowers. More precisely, if a
 *         customer has already bought x flowers, he should pay (x+1)*ci dollars
 *         to buy flower number i. You and your K-1 friends want to buy all N
 *         flowers in such a way that you spend the least amount of money. You
 *         can buy the flowers in any order.
 * 
 *         Input:
 * 
 *         The first line of input contains two integers N and K (K <= N). The
 *         next line contains N space separated positive integers c1,c2,...,cN.
 * 
 *         Output:
 * 
 *         Print the minimum amount of money you (and your friends) have to pay
 *         in order to buy all N flowers.
 *
