/**
 * @author Aakansha Doshi
 * 
 *         Chandan is an extremely biased person, and he dislikes people who
 *         fail to solve all the problems in the interview he takes for hiring
 *         people. There are n people on a day who came to be interviewed by
 *         Chandan.
 * 
 *         Chandan rates every candidate from 0 to 10. He has to output the
 *         total ratings of all the people who came in a day. But, here's the
 *         problem: Chandan gets extremely frustrated when someone ends up
 *         scoring a 0 in the interview. So in frustration he ends up removing
 *         the candidate who scored that 0, and also removes the candidate who
 *         came before him. If there is no candidate before the one who scores a
 *         0, he does nothing.
 * 
 *         You've to find the summation of all the ratings in a day for Chandan.
 * 
 *         Input constraints: The first line of input will contain an integer â€”
 *         n. The next n lines will contain an integer, where the ith integer
 *         represents the rating of the ith person.
 * 
 *         Output constraints: Print the required sum.
