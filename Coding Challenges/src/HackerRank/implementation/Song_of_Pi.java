 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *         Today is a special day, and let me sing a song to celebrate the day:
 * 
 *         "Now, I wish I could recollect pi. 'Eureka,' cried the great
 *         inventor. Christmas Pudding, Christmas Pie Is the problem's very
 *         center."
 * 
 *         Well, you may say it's a terrible song - but it's not! Ignore the
 *         punctuation marks and write down the length of each of word in this
 *         song.
 * 
 *         For example:
 * 
 *         "Now"=3, "I"=1, "wish"=4, etc etc
 * 
 *         Writing them together we get: 314159265358979323846
 * 
 *         That's the value of pi! (Ignoring the floating point) A song is a pi
 *         song if the length of its words represent the value of pi.
 * 
 *         Today, March 14, is the official Pi Day because 3/14 represents the
 *         first three significant digits of Pi. And today you will determine
 *         which songs are pi songs and which are not.
 * 
 *         Assume that value of pi is 3.1415926535897932384626433833. You don't
 *         need more digits for this problem; use the value exactly as it is,
 *         just ignore the floating point and don't perform any rounding
 *         operations.
 * 
 *         Input Format
 * 
 *         The first line will contain an integer T, representing the number of
 *         test cases. Each of the next T lines will contain a song. The songs
 *         will contain only English letters (a-z, A-Z) and will contain 1 to 29
 *         words.
 * 
 *         Constraints:
 * 
 *         No line will contain a total of more than_ 500 _characters. 1≤T≤100
 *         Length of each word is at most 9.
 * 
 *         Output Format
 * 
 *         For each test case, print "It's a pi song." or "It's not a pi song."
 *         depending on the input.
