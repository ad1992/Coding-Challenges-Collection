 *         Problem Statement
 * 
 *         Numeros, the Artist, had two lists A and B, such that B was a
 *         permutation of A. Numeros was very proud of these lists.
 *         Unfortunately, while transporting them from one exhibition to
 *         another, some numbers were left out of A. Can you find the missing
 *         numbers?
 * 
 *         Notes
 * 
 *         If a number occurs multiple times in the lists, you must ensure that
 *         the frequency of that number in both lists is the same. If that is
 *         not the case, then it is also a missing number. You have to print all
 *         the missing numbers in ascending order. Print each missing number
 *         once, even if it is missing multiple times. The difference between
 *         maximum and minimum number in B is less than or equal to 100.
 * 
 *         Input Format There will be four lines of input:
 * 
 *         n - the size of the first list This is followed by n space-separated
 *         integers that make up the first list. m - the size of the second list
 *         This is followed by m space-separated integers that make up the
 *         second list.
 * 
 *         Output Format Output the missing numbers in ascending order.
