 *         Problem Statement: Dom and Brian were trying to evade the truck
 *         drivers of Verone's gang. They were too fast, too furious for them,
 *         and could get away from the truck drivers easily. They decided to
 *         race with each other, and divided the city into N checkpoints for the
 *         same. Mia was monitoring Dom and Brian throughout the race and she
 *         noted down their speeds at every checkpoint.
 * 
 *         Roman was jobless, as usual, and told Mia that Dom would definitely
 *         have the maximum change in speed between any two consecutive
 *         checkpoints. Mia, disagreed with him and challenged him that Brian
 *         would have maximum change in speed.
 * 
 *         Help Mia and Roman to find out who has the maximum change in speed
 *         between any two consecutive checkpoints - Dom or Brian. Note: Both
 *         negative and positive changes have to be considered. Hence, absolute
 *         value of maximum change in speed is to be considered.
 * 
 *         Input: First line contains a positive integer N - total number of
 *         checkpoints Second line contains N space-separated integers - ai -
 *         the speeds of Dom's car at each checkpoint. Third line contains N
 *         space-separated integers - bi - the speeds of Brian's car at each
 *         checkpoint.
 * 
 *         Output: Print who had the maximum change in speed between 2
 *         consecutive checkpoints - Dom or Brian. If both have equal maximum
 *         change in speed, print "Tie". Print a single integer on a new line -
 *         the maximum absolute change in speed between 2 consecutive
 *         checkpoints.
